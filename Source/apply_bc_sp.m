function gamma = apply_bc_sp(params,gamma,gamma0,velocity)
    %APPLY_BC_SP Applies Boundary Condtions of Inlet to the left wall, no 
    % traction to the top and bottom wall, and convective outlet to the 
    % right wall of a data field stored in Node Space. This function is 
    % specifically created for the Nullspace Method. Refer to the reference
    % for further explanation.
    %
    % This works for three cases:
    %
    % If two argument is provided, the convective outlet is replaced
    % by the solid wall.
    % 
    % If three arguments are provided, the convective outlet uses the
    % reference velocity U (through the Courant Number) as the convecting
    % velocity.
    % 
    % If four arguments are provided, the convective outlet uses the
    % X-velocity field as the convecting velocity. Note that this is
    % unstable. *Do not use*
    %
    % gamma = APPLY_BC_SP(params,gamma,gamma0,velocity)
    %
    % Variable lookup:
    % 
    % gamma: Vorticity field (NodeData) on which the boundary conditions
    % are being applied.
    %
    % params: flow parameters.
    %
    % gamma0: Vorticity field (NodeData) from the previous time step. Used
    % to calculate the convective outlet boundary condition.
    %
    % velocity: Current Velocity field (EdgeData). Used to calculate the
    % convective outlet boundary condition.
    %
    % Nx: Number of divisions in the X-direction.
    %
    % Ny: Number of divisions in the Y-direction.
    %
    % dt: Size of each time step moved during one iteration.
    % 
    % dx: Size of each cell. *Ensure that dx = dy. The code will give
    % erroneous results otherwise.*
    %
    % Co: Courant Number defined by Co = U * dt / dx. Refer to reference
    % for further explanation.
